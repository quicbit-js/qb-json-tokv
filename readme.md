# qb-json-tokv

**NB qb-json-tokv underwent a major overhaul to a simpler and more effective design and became...**

**[qb-json-next](https://github.com/quicbit-js/qb-json-next)** 

qb-json-next now does everything qb-json-tokv wanted to achieve, and more including
full incremental parsing supoprt and an easier interface.

The callback interface (to a consistent function signature) has no performance advantages over
qb-json-next's simpler iteration and the state management of qb-json-next is far superior.
